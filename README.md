## Hello there!

My name is Maximilian and I mainly work with Java. I'm currently getting into Rust because the JVM is starting to get on my nerves. I'm also very interested in computer science.

I'm currently working on a few small projects. My main longterm project at the moment is [Spedcord](https://github.com/Spedcord).



### How to contact me

You can contact me on Discord (Cerus#5149) or you can [send an email](mailto:contact@cerus-dev.de) to my email address `contact@cerus-dev.de`.



By the way: I'm currently looking for work! Please get in touch with me if you'd like to hire me.
